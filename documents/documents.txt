SECTION 4: SCIENCE DIGEST – PHOTOSYNTHESIS

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants produce energy in the form of glucose. This occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells, where sunlight is used to convert water and carbon dioxide into sugar and oxygen.

Chemical Equation:
6CO₂ + 6H₂O + sunlight → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

The process is essential not just for plants but for all living organisms, as it forms the base of most food chains and produces the oxygen we breathe.

Fun Fact: Only about 1% of the sunlight that hits a leaf is used in photosynthesis—the rest is reflected or lost as heat.
